# 📷 Camera API Not Supported - Complete Solution

## The Problem
Your browser/PWA doesn't support the camera API, which is common with:
- Some mobile browsers
- PWA mode in certain browsers
- Older browser versions
- Security restrictions

## ✅ Complete Solution

### Option 1: Use Manual Door ID Input (Recommended)
**This works in ANY browser and is the most reliable method:**

1. **Open the main app:** `http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:3001`
2. **Login to your account**
3. **Tap "Scan QR Code"**
4. **When camera fails, tap "Enter Door ID Manually"**
5. **Type the door ID** (e.g., "1", "2", "3")
6. **Press OK** - the door will open!

### Option 2: Try Different Browsers
**Test these browsers in order:**

1. **Chrome (Android)** - Best camera support
2. **Safari (iOS)** - Good camera support  
3. **Edge (Android/iOS)** - Decent camera support
4. **Firefox** - Limited PWA camera support

### Option 3: Use Regular Browser Mode
**Instead of PWA mode:**

1. **Open in regular browser** (not PWA)
2. **Camera usually works better**
3. **You can still bookmark to home screen**

### Option 4: Try HTTPS
**Some browsers require HTTPS for camera:**

1. **Use localhost instead of IP:** `http://localhost:3001`
2. **Or set up HTTPS** (advanced)
