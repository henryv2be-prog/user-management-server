# Railway Deployment Guide for SimplifiAccess

This guide will help you deploy your SimplifiAccess server to Railway.

## Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Git Repository**: Your code should be in a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. **Node.js**: Version 16+ (Railway supports this automatically)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

Make sure your repository contains:
- âœ… `package.json` (already configured)
- âœ… `server.js` (your main server file)
- âœ… `railway.json` (Railway configuration)
- âœ… `Procfile` (start command)
- âœ… `.env.production` (production environment template)

### 2. Deploy to Railway

#### Option A: Deploy from GitHub/GitLab (Recommended)

1. **Connect Railway to GitHub**:
   - Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your SimplifiAccess repository
   - Click "Deploy Now"

2. **Railway will automatically**:
   - Detect it's a Node.js project
   - Install dependencies (`npm install`)
   - Start your server (`npm start`)

#### Option B: Deploy via Railway CLI

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize and Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway init
   railway up
   ```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

After deployment, configure your environment variables in Railway dashboard:

1. Go to your project in Railway dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add the following variables:

#### Required Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@simplifiaccess.com
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your-secure-admin-password
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

#### Optional Variables (with defaults):
```
PORT=3000
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=1000
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=10
```

### 4. Update Your App URL

1. After deployment, Railway will provide you with a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
2. Update the `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable with this URL
3. Update the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` if you have specific frontend domains

### 5. Database Considerations

**Important**: Railway's file system is ephemeral, meaning your SQLite database will be reset on each deployment.

#### Option A: Use Railway PostgreSQL (Recommended)
1. Add a PostgreSQL service in Railway
2. Update your database configuration to use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
3. This provides persistent storage

#### Option B: External Database
- Use a service like PlanetScale, Supabase, or AWS RDS
- Update your database connection string

#### Option C: Accept Ephemeral Database
- Your database will reset on each deployment
- Good for development/testing
- Not recommended for production with real data

### 6. Custom Domain (Optional)

1. In Railway dashboard, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain
3. Configure DNS records as instructed
4. Update environment variables with your custom domain

### 7. Monitoring and Logs

Railway provides:
- **Real-time logs**: View in Railway dashboard
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory usage
- **Health checks**: Automatic health monitoring via `/api/health`

### 8. Automatic Deployments

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to your connected branch:
- Push to `main` branch â†’ automatic deployment
- Configure branch settings in Railway dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Check Node.js version compatibility
   - Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
   - Check build logs in Railway dashboard

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Verify all required variables are set
   - Check variable names match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Database Issues**:
   - SQLite files are ephemeral on Railway
   - Consider switching to PostgreSQL for persistence

4. **Port Issues**:
   - Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable
   - Your app should use `process.env.PORT` (which you already do)

5. **CORS Issues**:
   - Update `FRONTEND_URL` and `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` with your Railway URL
   - Check CORS configuration in `server.js`

### Health Check Endpoints

Your app includes several health check endpoints:
- `/api/health` - Main health check
- `/api/ping` - Simple ping
- `/api/status` - Status information
- `/ping` - Basic ping

## Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Passwords**:
   - Update `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to a strong password
   - Change `JWT_SECRET` to a secure random string

2. **Environment Variables**:
   - Never commit `.env` files to Git
   - Use Railway's environment variable system

3. **HTTPS**:
   - Railway provides HTTPS automatically
   - Update your ESP32 devices to use HTTPS URLs

## Next Steps

1. **Test Your Deployment**:
   - Visit your Railway URL
   - Test API endpoints
   - Verify health checks

2. **Update ESP32 Configuration**:
   - Update ESP32 code to use your Railway URL
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled

3. **Set Up Monitoring**:
   - Configure alerts in Railway
   - Set up external monitoring if needed

4. **Backup Strategy**:
   - If using PostgreSQL, set up automated backups
   - Export important data regularly
