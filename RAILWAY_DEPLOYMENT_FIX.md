# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Server Startup Timeout
- **Problem**: Server had a 30-second startup timeout that was too short for Railway deployments
- **Fix**: Increased timeout to 60 seconds for production environments
- **Location**: `server.js` line 497-505

### 2. Database Initialization Delay
- **Problem**: 2-second delay after database initialization was too long for Railway
- **Fix**: Reduced delay to 500ms for production environments
- **Location**: `server.js` line 405-409

### 3. Missing Railway Environment Configuration
- **Problem**: No Railway-specific environment variables
- **Fix**: Created `.env.railway` with proper configuration
- **Location**: `.env.railway`

## Required Railway Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway dashboard:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
JWT_SECRET=efd442577d404a9664c502be38d20cc966c6763c6e70fe9d87b96cc6251fe240787948b93e761ad2fa386e318c158111b3bfad34dbdc90e2c3a8aae7a5dfabb2
DB_PATH=/tmp/users.db
BCRYPT_ROUNDS=12
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.railway.app
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend.railway.app
MOBILE_APP_SERVER_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Set Environment Variables**: Add the above variables in Railway dashboard
2. **Deploy**: Push these changes to trigger a new deployment
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway logs for any remaining issues

## Key Changes Made

- ✅ Increased startup timeout for production (30s → 60s)
- ✅ Reduced database delay for production (2000ms → 500ms)
- ✅ Added Railway-specific environment configuration
- ✅ Added railway:start script for explicit production startup

## Testing

The server should now start successfully on Railway with:
- Proper timeout handling
- Faster database initialization
- Correct environment configuration
